### Enqueuing the style to your theme

Add the following snippet into `functions.php`:

```
wp_enqueue_style( 'mpa-style-kit', 'path_to_compiled_style/style.css', array(), '1.0.0' );
```

### Enqueuing the style to Block Editor

If you are using default Block Editor, and want load styles there - then add the following snippet into `functions.php`:

```
add_theme_support('editor-styles');

add_editor_style( array(
    'path_to_compiled_style/style.css',
    /* here can be url to Google Font, or another style file */
) );
```

## Directory structure
For your convenience, all styles are logically divided into files. All files contain templates with the minimum set of selectors for styling different blocks.

```
